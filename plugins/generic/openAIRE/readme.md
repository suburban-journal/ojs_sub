# OpenAIRE Plugin 2.0

About
-----

This plugin adds a new OAI-PMH metadata format that complements the OpenAIRE Guidelines for Literature Repository Managers v4 (https://openaire-guidelines-for-literature-repository-managers.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.0/) and is optimized for works published in journals. The metadata format used is JATS XML format.

In section settings journals can choose a publication type from the COAR Resource Type vocabulary that best describes the articles published in that section (https://www.coar-repositories.org/activities/repository-interoperability/coar-vocabularies/deliverables/).

The article access rights are shown by using the COAR Access Rights Vocabulary (https://www.coar-repositories.org/activities/repository-interoperability/coar-vocabularies/access-rights-vocabulary/).

The OpenAIRE OAI metada format also contains a hook that can be used to inject funding data to the article entry. This means that journals can use any source of funding data they want. The funding Plugin for OJS3 supports this hook (https://github.com/ajnyga/funding).

The plugin has been developed in cooperation with OpenAIRE.

--------

Version 2.0 of the plugin was created by The Federation of Finnish
Learned Societies (https://tsv.fi) with funding provided by the Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft and Freie Universität Berlin/CeDiS.


Install
-------

### Installing using a release from Github:

 1. Download the latest compatible release from https://github.com/ojsde/openAIRE/releases. Unzip.
 2. Disable the old OpenAIRE plugin from Settings -> Website -> Plugins -> Generic Plugin -> OpenAIRE Plugin.
 3. Remove the old OpenAIRE plugin folder from plugins/generic/.
 4. Move the new OpenAIRE plugin folder to OJS plugins/generic/ folder.
 5. Go to Settings -> Website -> Plugins -> Generic Plugin -> OpenAIRE Plugin and enable the plugin.

If you are hosting a single site with several OJS journals, you can enable the plugin from the site settings. This enables the custom OAI-PMH metadata format for the whole site. However, other features, like allowing journals to define content types for articles within specific sections, requires that journals enable the plugin from their own settings.


How to use the plugin
---------------------

After enabling the plugin you will see a new metadata format called *oai_openaire_jats* in your OAI-PMH.

You can go to Settings > Journal > Sections and edit the section settings. The settings form has a pull down menu that allows you to select a COAR Resource Type that best describes the articles published in that section. The selected resource type will be shown in the OAI-PMH metadata.

You can collect and attach funding data by installing and enabling the Funding plugin for OJS3 (https://github.com/ajnyga/funding).


How to register to OpenAIRE
---------------------------

### A) OJS journals that have already registered with OpenAIRE

After enabling the new OpenAIRE plugin, please open a ticket at OpenAIRE Helpdesk under https://www.openaire.eu/support/helpdesk (choose “Content Providers”) and let us know that you want your metadata to be included in the JATS format by using the new OpenAIRE plugin for OJS.

If you have used the old OpenAIRE plugin and have saved FP7 project ID's to the database, the new plugin will still show them in OAI-PMH.

### B) OJS journals that have not registered with OpenAIRE

    Desired Compatibility Level: Choose "OpenAIRE 3.0"
    
    Click Next and you are ready.
    
    Your OJS site is now registered with OpenAIRE.

7. After registering your journal/site with OpenAIRE a validation process will start and you will be notified of the results. Note that currently the validation may fail, because OpenAIRE is still lacking the required validation rules for the JATS format that the new OpenAIRE plugin uses. However, this will not prevent your content of being registered with OpenAIRE.  

8. Please open a ticket at OpenAIRE Helpdesk under https://www.openaire.eu/support/helpdesk (choose “Content Providers”) to draw attention to your registration and let us know that you want your metadata to be included in the JATS format. 

Note, that eventually the registration process will be updated to include the JATS-option so that the last step of this guide will be redundant.
